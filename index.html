            <p>
              Welcome and thank you for veiwing my career portfolio. I wish I
              could tell you, that I have got extensive experience as a full stack web
              developer and I'm the best in the business. Yeah, that would be a
              lie, What is not a lie however is that, I am still very early in my
              career as a software and web developer, I have just complete my diploma in 
              information technology at University and I have obtained better results.
              I do not have much industry experience but I have developed amazing projects
               through "hands-on" approach and commitment in school and in my personal projects.

                Managers are able to setup the store including registering new employees, adding and removing products, 
                increasing and decreasing prices, discounts and adding supplier information. They have an additional feature

                Stuff are allowed to login to the system and make sales. The system allows the stuff to make sales and return sales. 
                They are also allowed to capture customer details for orders made and they are able to edit that captured information.

            <p class="year-one education">
              This was a school project that I developed in 2021. This is a dice rolling game that basically allows a user to play agianst
              the computer. The user rolls 5 dices by clicking the play button displayed on screen, after clicking the button, the game then rolls 
              the dices for the user and automatically rolls 5 dices again for the computer. The winner is decided on the hierarchy of the die values
              for example 6 of a kind, beats 5 of a kind. If both the players have the same combinationof dice, the highest values wins, for example
              two 4's beats two 3's. The score is displayed after each dice roll on the top of the left and right side of the screen. <br><br>
              The game was developed using C# programming language, it was created using Visual Studio 2017 version. I used alot of graphics such as images 
              and audio to make it more like the casino gambling games. The audio was mastered using the A.I skill which monitors the movements of the players
              during the game.

            <b class="education proj-year">Durban Taxi Mobile Application.</b>
            <p class="year-one education">
              This was a school project that I developed in 2021. This is an online learning system
                that allows the teachers or lectures to create one to three tests for their students. The
                students are allowed to take one test at a time and each student is graded at the end of each
                test. <br><br>
                This system was created using Angular and ionic. It was developed using Visual Studio code, NodeJS, Firebase and PhpMySQL Server. <br><br>
                <b>What the app does </b><br>
                My taxi mobile app intends to manage the taxi business by conveying to client's brief information of a specific 
                taxi, its driver, and its owner. This shall help to uniquely identify each taxi in cases of accidents, bad driving, hiring, and 
                reporting. Clients will have to enter a taxi number plate to access information of each taxi. My app will enable taxi 
                associations to join the service by enabling taxi owners to register their taxis on the app. It will capture brief details of each taxi such as number plate, name, 
                model, color, picture, driver, driver's cellphone number, taxi rank, route, and association office location as well as the owners name and cellphone 
                number.<br>
                My app will enable passengers to enter their trip details such as where they are departing from to their destination and will tell them how much 
                that trip will cost and estimate the time it normally takes to get there. It will have a feature to generate the total cost of a trip according to the 
                number of people (passengers). It will notify passenger when there is an increase on taxi fees.<br>
                This app will create a platform for passengers to review the services they receive while in a specific taxi good or bad.
                It will provide passengers, pedestrians, and other road users with a platform to report reckless taxi driving using it number plate.
                Also enable passengers to recover their belongs by enabling them to contact the taxi driver personally using the driver's cellphone number 
                provided on the app. Passenger can also submit a report directly to the taxi associations office immediately.

            <p class="year-one education">
              <i
                >This was a school project that I developed in 2020. This is an post of sales management system that
                allows a shop to sell their product to their customers effectively. The system allows the shop to add
                and remove any products any time to the system and the system calculates the total sales and custmer 
                change accordingly. <br><br>
                This system was created using java programming language, it was developed using the latest
                version of Netbeans. It allows the users such as admins,managers and stuff to register and login to
                the system. Managers and stuff have separate user panels, with different interfaces and functions.
                Managers are able to setup the store including registering new employees, adding and removing products, 
                increasing and decreasing prices, discounts and adding supplier information. They have an additional feature
                that enables them to view sales of the store and also according to which stuff memeber was at the cash register.

                Stuff are allowed to login to the system and make sales. The system allows the stuff to make sales and return sales. 
                They are also allowed to capture customer details for orders made and they are able to edit that captured information.
                The system allows the stuff member to view all the sales and slips that they have made at the store.
